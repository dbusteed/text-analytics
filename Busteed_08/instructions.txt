# Instructions:
# Write a Python program that harvests tweets from the Twitter API with a 
# hashtag of a company of your choice and saves the tweets to your hard 
# drive as a .json file. The tweets should have a language tag of English 
# ("lang":"en"). The program should then calculate the mean sentiment ("compound"
#  score) in the tweets. Next, within the already-collected tweets, search for a 
# product keyword (or hashtag) that the company makes and calculate the mean 
# sentiment score for those tweets. The program should print to screen whether 
# the mean sentiment score for the product is lower or higher than the mean sentiment 
# score for the company overall. Finally, your program should extract the five most 
# frequent words other than function words (you decide which ones to exclude) in 
# tweets about the product with a positive sentiment score. Do the same for tweets 
# with a negative sentiment score. The five words in positive tweets and the five words 
# in negative tweets should be printed to screen.

# Write a report in a .docx file in which you interpret the results. Does the product
#  have a mean sentiment score higher or lower than the company overall? If so, why do 
# you think that is the case? Which five frequent words occur in positive tweets about
#  the product? Which words in negative tweets? Why do you think that his the case?
